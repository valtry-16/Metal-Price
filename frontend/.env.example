# Auric Ledger Frontend Environment Variables

# Production API Backend URL (for deployed frontend)
# Leave empty to auto-detect localhost:4000 (dev) or fallback to hardcoded production URL
# VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend.onrender.com

# When running frontend locally:
# - If backend is running on localhost:4000, it will auto-detect and use it
# - If localhost:4000 is not available, it will use VITE_API_BASE_URL
# - If VITE_API_BASE_URL is not set, it falls back to https://your-backend.onrender.com

# For production deployment (e.g., Vercel):
# Set VITE_API_BASE_URL to your deployed backend URL
